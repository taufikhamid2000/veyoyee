# Reputation System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive reputation system for the Veyoyee survey platform. This system tracks user reputation across all their survey activities and provides incentives for quality responses.

## What Was Added

### 1. Database Schema Changes (`20250706200006_add_reputation_system.sql`)

#### New Users Table (`veyoyee.users`)

- Stores user profiles and reputation data
- Automatically created when new users sign up via trigger
- Fields include:
  - `total_reputation`: Overall reputation score
  - `surveys_completed`: Number of surveys user has completed
  - `surveys_created`: Number of surveys user has created
  - `responses_accepted`: Number of user's responses that were accepted
  - `responses_rejected`: Number of user's responses that were rejected
  - Profile fields: `username`, `display_name`, `bio`, `avatar_url`, etc.

#### Enhanced Individual Responses Table

- Added `reputation_awarded` column to track reputation points for each response
- Triggers automatically update user reputation when responses are accepted/rejected

#### Automated Triggers

- **User Profile Creation**: Automatically creates user profile when new user signs up
- **Reputation Updates**: Updates user reputation when response status changes
- **Survey Completion Tracking**: Increments surveys_completed count
- **Survey Creation Tracking**: Increments surveys_created count

### 2. Service Layer Updates (`survey-response-service.ts`)

#### New Methods Added

- `getUserProfile()`: Get user profile with reputation data
- `updateUserProfile()`: Update user profile information
- `getReputationLeaderboard()`: Get top users by reputation
- `getUserReputationStats()`: Get detailed reputation statistics for a user
- `awardReputation()`: Manually award reputation points (admin function)

#### Enhanced Existing Methods

- `getSurveyResponsesWithAnswers()`: Now returns actual reputation data instead of random scores
- Includes both response-specific reputation and user's total reputation

### 3. TypeScript Types (`types/index.ts`)

#### New Types Added

- `VeyoyeeUser`: User profile with reputation fields
- `UserReputationStats`: Detailed reputation statistics
- `LeaderboardEntry`: Leaderboard user data structure
- `SurveyResponseWithReputation`: Enhanced response data with reputation info

## How Reputation Works

### Automatic Reputation Awards

- **Accepted Response**: +5 reputation points
- **Rejected Response**: -5 reputation points (yes, reputation can go negative!)
- **Survey Completion**: Tracked for statistics (no direct reputation impact)
- **Survey Creation**: Tracked for statistics (no direct reputation impact)

### Reputation Range

- **No upper cap**: Reputation can go as high as needed for ranking purposes
- **No lower cap**: Reputation can go negative (shows poor response quality)
- **Display logic**: Shows exact number, but "100+" when >= 100 in UI

### Reputation Tiers

Based on total reputation score:

- **Probation** (< 0): Red badge - negative reputation
- **Novice** (0-4): Gray badge - new or struggling users
- **Beginner** (5-19): Yellow badge - getting started
- **Intermediate** (20-49): Green badge - reliable contributor
- **Advanced** (50-99): Blue badge - experienced user
- **Expert** (100+): Purple badge - top contributor (shows as "100+")

### Manual Reputation Awards

- Admins can manually award reputation using `awardReputation()` method
- Useful for special achievements, quality contributions, etc.

### Reputation Tracking

- Real-time updates via database triggers
- Allows negative reputation (no minimum cap)
- Tracks detailed statistics for user profiles

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic User Management

- Users automatically get profiles when they sign up
- All reputation changes are tracked automatically
- No manual intervention required for basic operations

### 2. Comprehensive Statistics

- User rank calculations
- Detailed response statistics
- Activity tracking (surveys created/completed)

### 3. Leaderboard System

- Query top users by reputation
- Configurable result limits
- Includes key statistics for each user

### 4. Data Integrity

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect user data
- Users can only update their own profiles
- Service role has full access for automated operations
- Triggers ensure data consistency

## Database Migrations Applied

- `20250706200006_add_reputation_system.sql`: Complete reputation system setup

## API Integration

The reputation system is fully integrated with the existing survey response workflow:

- When survey creators accept/reject responses, reputation is automatically updated
- Results pages now show actual reputation data
- User profiles can be queried and updated

## Future Enhancements (Ready to Implement)

- Configurable reputation point values
- Reputation decay over time
- Achievement system
- Reputation-based access controls
- Detailed reputation history logging

## Build Status

✅ **All changes compile successfully with no errors**
✅ **TypeScript types are properly defined**
✅ **Database migrations are ready to deploy**
✅ **Service layer methods are fully functional**

The reputation system is now complete and ready for production use!
