## Why I'm Selling

I developed this platform as a side project with AI assistance, but don't have the time or interest to operate it as a business. Rather than let it sit unused, I'm offering it for sale to someone who can bring it to market.

This is a straightforward code sale - you get the complete project and all rights to it.

## FAQ

**Q: Are there any licensing restrictions?**
A: The code is provided under the MIT License, which is extremely permissive. You can modify, distribute and use it for any purpose, including commercial applications.

**Q: Do I need to maintain any attributions or notices?**
A: While the MIT License technically requires maintaining the license notice, the sale includes a provision that waives this requirement for the buyer's commercial use.

**Q: What about the third-party libraries used?**
A: All dependencies use permissive licenses (mostly MIT) that allow commercial use. A comprehensive THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md document is included for compliance.

**Q: Is the code ready to deploy?**
A: Yes, with minor configuration. You'll need to set up your own Supabase instance and hosting.

**Q: Are there any recurring costs?**
A: Only standard hosting costs (Vercel/Netlify) and Supabase if you exceed free tier limits.

**Q: Can I rebrand it?**
A: Yes, you'll own all rights to modify, rebrand or resell as you wish.

**Q: Is a demo available?**
A: I can provide screenshots but no live demo is available.

**Q: What about support after purchase?**
A: The documentation should cover setup needs, but no ongoing support is included.
