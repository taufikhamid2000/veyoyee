# Veyoyee Project Analysis Summary

## Project Overview

**Veyoyee** is an incentivized survey platform designed primarily for academic and nonprofit researchers. It's a modern web application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, created by taufikhamid2000.

## Core Concept

The platform operates on a two-sided marketplace model:

- **Researchers/Surveyors** create surveys and offer rewards for participation
- **Respondents** browse surveys, participate, and earn tokens/cash rewards
- **Survey Creation Pass (SCP)** system: Respondents must complete 100 academic surveys to unlock survey creation abilities

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom animations and dark mode
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Zustand** for state management

### Backend & Database

- **Supabase** for authentication and PostgreSQL database
- **Supabase SSR** for server-side rendering support

### UI Framework

- **Radix UI** components (Avatar, Dialog, Dropdown, Tabs)
- **Shadcn/ui** component system
- Custom theme provider with dark/light mode support

## Current Features

### Authentication System

- Email/password authentication via Supabase
- Protected routes with middleware
- Session management with cookie persistence
- User profile management
- Automatic redirects (signin → dashboard, etc.)

### Survey Management

- **Survey Creation**: Form builder with multiple question types
- **Survey Types**: Academia vs Commerce surveys
- **Question Limits**: 3-10 questions per survey
- **Reward System**: Token/cash incentives
- **Status Management**: Draft, Active, Closed surveys

### User Roles & Permissions

- **Respondents**: Browse surveys, participate, earn rewards
- **Admin**: Platform management (basic structure present)

### Dashboard Features

- Personal survey statistics
- Recent activity tracking
- Survey management interface
- User preferences and settings

### Survey Features

- Multiple question types (multiple choice, short answer, etc.)
- Survey respondent limits (min/max)
- Date range settings
- Reward calculation per respondent
- Survey exploration/browsing interface

## Current Development Status

### Completed

✅ Authentication system with Supabase
✅ Basic UI framework and theming
✅ Survey creation form
✅ User dashboard
✅ Navigation and routing
✅ Mock data structure
✅ Responsive design
✅ Dark/light mode support
✅ Enhanced Form Validation & Error Handling

- Created reusable FormField, TextareaField, and SelectField components
- Implemented comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all forms
- Added useValidatedForm hook for consistent form handling
- Enhanced sign-in and sign-up forms with proper validation
- Added toast notification system for user feedback
- Improved form UX with loading states and error display

### In Progress/Mock Data

🔄 Survey data is currently mocked (not connected to database)
🔄 Payment/reward system (structure exists, not implemented)
🔄 Survey analytics and results
🔄 Admin panel features

### Missing/Needs Implementation

❌ Database schema and migrations
❌ Stripe integration for payments
❌ Survey response collection
❌ Real survey analytics
❌ Email notifications
❌ Survey sharing functionality
❌ Advanced survey logic (skip patterns)

## Key Pain Points Addressed

Based on the competitor analysis documentation, Veyoyee aims to solve:

- **SurveyMonkey**: Overly complex interface and expensive pricing
- **Google Forms**: Limited features and no incentive system
- **Academic Research**: Difficulty recruiting respondents
- **Survey Fatigue**: Providing meaningful incentives for participation

## Business Model

- **Academic Surveys**: Researchers earn Survey Creation Passes (SCPs) by participating
- **Commerce Surveys**: Direct payment model for business surveys
- **Token System**: Respondents earn rewards that can be cashed out via Stripe

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Database Setup**: Create proper Supabase tables and relationships
2. **Payment Integration**: Implement Stripe for reward payouts
3. **Survey Logic**: Complete survey response collection and storage
4. **Analytics**: Build survey results and analytics features
5. **Testing**: Expand test coverage beyond basic auth tests
6. **Deployment**: Set up production environment

The project shows a solid foundation with modern architecture and good development practices, but needs backend integration to become fully functional.
